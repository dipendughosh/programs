-  McAfee SystemGuards

behaviors that can signal virus, spyware, or hacker 
activity.

PERSONAL FIREWALL

Personal Firewall provides complete inbound and 
outbound firewall protection and automatically trusts 
known good programs and helps blocks spyware, Trojans, 
and key loggers. Firewall allows you to defend against 
hacker probes and attacks, monitors Internet and 
network activity, alerts you to hostile or suspicious 
events, provides detailed information about Internet 
traffic, and complements antivirus defenses.

-  Standard and custom protection levels
Guard against intrusion and suspicious activity using 
Firewall's default protection settings or customize 
Firewall to your own security needs.

-  Real-time recommendations
Receive recommendations, dynamically, to help you 
determine whether programs should be granted Internet 
access or network traffic should be trusted.

-  Intelligent access management for programs
Manage Internet access for programs, through alerts 
and Event Logs, or configure access permissions for 
specific programs from Firewall's Program Permissions 
pane. 

-  Gaming protection
Prevent alerts regarding intrusion attempts and 
suspicious activities from distracting you during 
full-screen gameplay and configure Firewall to 
display alerts following completion of the 
computer game.

-  Computer startup protection
Before Windows opens, Firewall protects your 
computer from intrusion attempts and unwanted 
programs and network traffic.

-  System service port control
System Service ports can provide a backdoor to 
your computer. Firewall allows you to create and 
manage open and closed system service ports required 
by some programs.

-  Manage computer connections
Trust and ban remote connections and IP addresses 
that can connect to your computer.

-  HackerWatch information integration
HackerWatch is a security information hub that 
tracks global hacking and intrusion patterns as well 
as providing the most up-to-date information about 
programs on your computer. You can view global 
security event and Internet port statistics.

-  Lockdown Firewall
Instantly block all inbound and outbound Internet 
traffic between your computer and the Internet.

-  Restore Firewall
Instantly restore the original protection settings 
for Firewall. If Personal Firewall exhibits 
undesirable behavior that you cannot correct, you 
can restore Firewall to its default settings.

-  Advanced Trojan detection 
Combines program connection management with an 
enhanced database to detect and block potentially 
malicious applications, such as Trojans, from 
accessing the Internet and relaying your personal 
data.

-  Event logging
Specify whether you want to enable or disable 
logging and, when enabled, which event types to 
log. Event logging allows you to view recent 
inbound and outbound events. You can also view 
intrusion detected events.

-  Monitor Internet traffic
Review easy-to-read graphical maps showing the 
source of hostile attacks and traffic worldwide. 
In addition, locate detailed owner information 
and geographical data for originating IP addresses. 
Also analyze inbound and outbound traffic, monitor 
program bandwidth and program activity.

-  Intrusion prevention 
Protect your privacy by providing intrusion 
prevention of possible Internet threats. Using 
heuristic-like functionality, McAfee provides a 
tertiary layer of protection by blocking items that 
display symptoms of attacks or characteristics of 
hacking attempts.

-  Sophisticated traffic analysis 
Review both inbound and outbound Internet traffic 
and program connections, including those that are 
actively listening for open connections. This 
allows you to see and act upon programs that can 
be vulnerable to intrusion.

DATA BACKUP

Data Backup provides the following features to 
save and restore your photos, music, and other 
important files.

-  Local scheduled archiving

Protect your data by archiving files and folders 
to CD, DVD, USB drive, external hard drive, or 
network drive. After you initiate the first 
archive, incremental archives occur automatically 
for you. 

-  One-click restore

If files and folders are mistakenly deleted or 
become corrupt on your computer, you can restore 
the most recently archived versions from the 
archive media used.

-  Compression and encryption

By default, your archived files are compressed, 
which saves space on your archive media. As an 
additional security measure, your archives are 
encrypted by default.

EASYNETWORK (3-USER LICENSE ONLY)

EasyNetwork provides the following features.

-  File sharing
EasyNetwork makes it easy to share files on 
your computer with other computers on the 
network. When you share files, you grant other 
computers read-only access to those files. Only 
computers who are members of the managed network 
(that is, with full or administrative access) 
can share files or access files shared by other 
members.

-  File transfer

You can send files to other computers that are 
members of the managed network. When you

for all the files that are sent to you by other 
computers on the network. 

-  Automated printer sharing

After you join a managed network, EasyNetwork 
automatically shares any local printers attached
