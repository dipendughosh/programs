Hello,
    I have used html for the interface ..so I have attached  www folder along with cgi-bin folder...
  I have used the database name "test"  and the table is student...
User name of my Mysql  root and without any password..
Beside all , I have just writen all the codes to test the feature of perl for cgi programming  ..So they are not good looking and well organized ...

Note:  You may replace localhost with ur IP address  . Then send url of the html file along with ur IP e.g http://117.193.178.12/database.html  to ur friend ...He/she can use the html code...donot forget to replace localhost with ur ip in the html file...
