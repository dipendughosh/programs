<hr>

The task of automated image registration can be divided into two major    
components: 1) the extraction of features from images; and 2) the search    
among the extracted features for the matching pairs that represent the same    
object in the field of view of the images to be matched.<br><br>     
   
A new method was introduced for automated registration of DEM (Digital    
Elevation Model) <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/twodems.shtml"> images</a> with different noise levels    
and amounts of missing data.  With this new method, instead of using    
isolated points of interest, edges in a generalized sense are first    
extracted from the DEM images as the features on which the whole registration    
process is based.  The <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/vedges.shtml"> edges</a> are extracted with multiple variance filters of    
different widths followed by a linear feature extraction method based on    
local maximum convolution.  As the second step, the shape of the extracted    
edges is represented with a rotation-invariant code that is generated    
dynamically for each sub-section of an edge.  Then the similarity of two <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/refined.shtml"> edges</a>, 
one from each image, is evaluated with a parameter that reflects both the length of the edges and    
the linear correlation coefficient calculated from their rotation-invariant    
codes.  When the matching edge pairs are determined, the corresponding pixels    
within each edge pair are used as "tie points" to construct a redundant    
equation set for a least squares solution for the projection parameters to <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/mrged.shtml"> merge</a>    
one DEM image into another, or one image of any type that is registered with    
the first DEM into another that is registered with the second DEM. For this pair 
of <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/twodems.shtml">images</a>, a total of 856 pixels from four matched 
edge pairs served as "tie points" to form 1712 equations, from which 
four projection parameters (one scaling, one rotation and two translations) were 
obtained.&nbsp; The entire    
process requires little human intervention.<br> 
<br> 
As a <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/delta.shtml"> quality check</a>, after projecting one DEM into the other, the difference 
between the two corresponding pixels was calculated, if there is no missing data 
in either image.<br>

Another example of a registered <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/origm.shtml">DEM pair </a> and the    
corresponding <a href="http://www.prettyview.com/mtch/flipm.shtml">mosaic image</a> of a radar image and a    
digitized aerial photo are shown on separate pages.
