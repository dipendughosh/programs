1.select an initial estimate for the global threshold T.
2. segment the image using T using the eq.
		g(x,y)= 1, if (x,y)>T
		         = 0, if (x,y)<=T
 this will produce two groups of pixels:G1 consisting of all the pixels with intensity values>T,& G2 consisting of pixels with intensity value<=T.
3. compute the avg intensity values m1 & m2 for the pixels in G1 & G2, respectively.
4. compute a new threshold 
		T= (m1+m2)/2
5. repeat step 2 through 4 untill the differnce between values of T in succesive iterations is smaller than a predefine parameter T.
