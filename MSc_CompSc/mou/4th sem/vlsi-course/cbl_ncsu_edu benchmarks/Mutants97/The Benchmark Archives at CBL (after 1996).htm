We introduce EQUIVALENCE CLASSES  of benchmarks within each directory as
follows:
</p><blockquote>
<menu>
<li>2 layer graphs in the directory <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/2-layer-graphs/tree.html">2-layer-graphs</a>
</li><li>two-level combinational in the directory <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/PLA/tree.html">  PLA </a>
</li><li>multi-level combinational in the directory <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/ML-COMB/tree.html">  ML-COMB </a>

</li><li>multi-level sequential in the directory <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/ML-SEQ/tree.html">  ML-SEQ </a>
</li></menu></blockquote>

<p>
The directory  <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/PLA">PLA</a> contains 100 functional descriptions in each equivalence
class. The first sets of experiments with some of these PLAs are
available in
<a href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/publications/#1996-Thesis-PhD-Zemva"> 1996-Thesis-PhD-Zemva.</a>
</p><p>
The directory  <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/ML-COMB">ML-COMB</a> contains 100+1 combinational mutant circuits in each
equivalence class. The procedure for generating the equivalence class mutants
is described in <a href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/publications/#1996-TR@CBL-04-Ghosh"> 1996-TR@CBL-04-Ghosh. </a>
The first sets of experiments with some of these
mutants have been described in

Similar to the directory 
<a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/ML-COMB">ML-COMB</a>, the 
directory <a href="http://cbl.ncsu.edu/benchmarks/Mutants97/ML-SEQ">ML-SEQ</a> will contain 100+1
sequential mutant circuits in each equivalence class. It is scheduled for
release by mid-April 1997. Presently, only descriptions of the reference
circuits we plan to use are archived in this directory.
</p><p>
Some of the factors that motivate the introduction of equivalence classes
of circuit mutants are the following:
</p><blockquote>
<menu>
<li> Today, typical experiments that report `performance' of EDA algorithms
are based on isolated instances of circuit benchmarks, leading to results
that can be inconclusive.

</li><li> Construction of a large sample of circuits that belong to the same
equivalence class is now feasible. We take a signature sigma_0 of a SINGLE
reference circuit eta_0 and construct an equivalence class of
signature-invariant 'mutants' eta_i in the class N_sigma_0 (i &gt; 0). Such
circuits will have the same number of I/Os, the same number of nodes, and
the same number of pins, distributed across the same number of levels.

</li><li> Experiments with the proposed selection of mutants from the respective
equivalence classes demonstrate consistently and unambiguously  that the
design objectives, being optimized by various algorithms, behave as random
variables and give rise to well-defined `distributions of circuit mutants'.


</li><li> Even simple demonstration circuits such as roth'62 from
      J. P. Roth, R. M. Karp,
      Minimization over Boolean Graphs,
      IBM Journal of Research and Development, April 1962
and its mutants can be shown to represent a non-trivial challenge to the
current generation of logic optimization algorithms.

</li><li> While some reference circuits appear easy candidates for generation of
canonical ROBDD representations, THEIR MUTANTS MANY NOT BE. Even trivial mutation
classes, such as isomorphic netlists in randomized order, can induce
unpredictable execution of some ROBDD-based algorithms!!
