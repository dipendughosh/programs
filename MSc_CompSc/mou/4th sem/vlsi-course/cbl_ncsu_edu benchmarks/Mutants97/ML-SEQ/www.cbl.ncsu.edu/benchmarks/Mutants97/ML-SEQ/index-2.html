We ask you to post any comments and suggestions about the contents of this
directory using our
<A href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/DiscussionGroups/Benchmark-reviews/"> PosterNotes </A>.
We solicit contributions of additional circuit descriptions that we may
use to generate equivalence mutant classes.
<P>
We plan to upgrade the directory ML-SEQ to be structured similarly as the
adjacent directory ML-COMB. The directory will contain 100 sequential
mutant circuits in each equivalence class. It is scheduled for release by
mid-April 1997. We presently archive only the reference circuits.
<P>
The reference circuits shown in table below have been chosen in order of
increasing complexity. <BR>

<P>
Unless noted otherwise, the sequential REFERENCE circuits in this directory
are based on circuits described in User Guide
<A href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/publications/#1991-IWLS-UG-Saeyang"> 1991-IWLS-UG-Saeyang</A>.
See this document for more details about data formats. Note that the
reference circuits themselves have been preprocessed into a logically
equivalent form before the generation of the respective circuit mutants.
<P>
The reference circuit avq in THIS DIRECTORY is a new addition to the
benchmark set. More details about its construction are available in
<A href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/publications/#1997-TR@CBL-01-Ghosh"> 1997-TR@CBL-01-Ghosh</A>,
<A href="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/publications/#1997-ISPD-Kapur"> 1997-ISPD-Kapur</A>.

<P>
Directory Organization: <BR>
The circuits are simply listed in a compressed format. These will be
expanded into respective directories of circuit mutants later.
