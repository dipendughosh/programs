Sequential Benchmarks 1997

[Image]

We ask you to post any comments and suggestions about the contents of this
directory using our PosterNotes . We solicit contributions of additional
circuit descriptions that we may use to generate equivalence mutant classes.

We plan to upgrade the directory ML-SEQ to be structured similarly as the
adjacent directory ML-COMB. The directory will contain 100 sequential mutant
circuits in each equivalence class. It is scheduled for release by mid-April
1997. We presently archive only the reference circuits.

The reference circuits shown in table below have been chosen in order of
increasing complexity.

Unless noted otherwise, the sequential REFERENCE circuits in this directory
are based on circuits described in User Guide 1991-IWLS-UG-Saeyang. See this
document for more details about data formats. Note that the reference
circuits themselves have been preprocessed into a logically equivalent form
before the generation of the respective circuit mutants.

The reference circuit avq in THIS DIRECTORY is a new addition to the
benchmark set. More details about its construction are available in
1997-TR@CBL-01-Ghosh, 1997-ISPD-Kapur.

Directory Organization:
The circuits are simply listed in a compressed format. These will be
expanded into respective directories of circuit mutants later.
