/*  NOTES  */

/*  The NPLUS and PPLUS rules refer to layers that are not used by
    this process and many others. These layers typically overlapped
    the DIFF layers and may have been used as an implant mask. The
    corresponding CIF layers (CNP and CPP) are stripped by the
    mcif_to_vcif program. These rules are left in here, but set equal
    to the corresponding DIFF rules, but with no overlap. These rules
    are denoted by $$$ in their comment fields.  */


/* polycon and md contacts in mosis3.0 are context sensitive, and it
   is not clear how to currently implement the rules. the space
   required between contacts on adjacent different-net poly is
   greater by one lambda than implied by either the poly-poly space
   of the overlap regions or by the contact-contact space. Also
   the open space between a polycon and an adjacent wire is greater
   than implied by enforcement of the poly space rule. Their
   "simple" contact rule deals with this by specifying a larger
   poly overlap of contact window by 2 lambda (instead of the
   normal 1 lambda). This, however, causes unnecessarily large
   space between an adjacent pair of polycon and md contacts. This
   file currently specifies the 2 lambda overlap, although the 
   contacts are constructed with 1 lambda overlap. The 2 lambda
   spec merely causes the compactor to generate the proper space. 
   An analogous set of context sensitive rules exists for md's */
