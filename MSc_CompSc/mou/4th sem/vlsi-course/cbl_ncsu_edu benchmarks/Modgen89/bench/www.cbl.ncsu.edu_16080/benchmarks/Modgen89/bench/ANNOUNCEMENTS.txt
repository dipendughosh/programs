Feb 10, 1989:

A bug has been reported in the ti_alu.vpnr example.  There is a revised
version of this example contained in revised_ti_alu.vpnr (in the alu directory)
in which these problems were corrected.  Because of the way this example is
generated (from schematics), the file itself is significantly different
than the original.  We ask that all participants do both the original 
and new versions. If you can only do one, it is probably best to do 
the revised version.  When reporting results, please state whether you 
used the revised description or the original.

The following is the description of the problem, as reported
by Janie Irwin of Penn State:

	In the benchmark ti_alu the following mistakes were discovered...

	  In leaf cell ti_alu_sub_8 should be a aoi5432 instead of a aoi4432.
	  The first and gate should input c, w_a_0, w_a_1, w_a_2, and m_b.  The
	  w_a_2 input is missing.

	  In leaf cell ti_alu_sub_11 the w_b_1 in the first and gate should
	  be a w_a_1 instead.

	  In leaf cell ti_alu_sub_12 should be a four input nand gate, not a
	  three input.  Someone forgot the f2 input.

	Checked the rest of this benchmark and it looks ok.  (It is, in fact,
	one of the benchmarks we have used in the past.)

Consider this change a test of your software's adaptability to
changing user specifications.

good luck and good hacking,
Mike Lorenzetti and Dwight Hill

An error in pin names has been discovered in the vpnr database.
The file "bench/db.vpnr" has been modified to correct this problem.
Here is the original description of the problem (again, from Janie
Irwin and her collegues at PSU):

A critical race was found in the flexibility benchmark by Janie Erwin.
This appears only in the ``simplified'' version: (e.i. the CMOS
version that does not use complex gates or pass transistors contained
in "accum.simple.vpnr"). The circuit might work if the skew 
between clk and clk_b (clock and clock bar)
was kept very small, but it would not be robust. Janie suggested
an alternative fflop structure based on 6 NAND gates, to which
we added inverters to make the set and reset inputs work the
same as in the old version. The transistor count happens to be unchanged.
The new version is contained in "revised_accum.simple.vpnr"
Please lay out both versions if possible. 

Note also that the ``database'' for the FSM section uses flipflops
with scan line inputs. As explained in the README file, these
inputs are purposely not connected. Your software is free to connect
them. These flipflops use pass transistors, as is industry standard
for FSM's (and almost all other CMOS circuits).

A hanging transistor in the dr2s cell (in the vpnr database) has 
been reconnected (signal n2 should have been n1).  The file 
"bench/db.vpnr" has been modified to correct this problem.

Also, a library of layout skeletons of standard cells
has been added in the 'layout' directory. The library contains only
metal1 and metal2 layers since the layouts are proprietary.  They can
be used for producing layouts or for connectivity checks in standard
cell based systems.  A CIF library is also included in layout/db.cif.
The cells are done in MOSIS SCMOS with lambda=1.5 micron.
