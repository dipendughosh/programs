*This seems utterly simple, and I'll swear I've seen phase plots
*working before.  I must be doing something incredibly stupid,
*but I think I should see a phase of -90 degrees or something...

ac lin 40 8.0e7 3.2e8
current n1 gnd 0.0 acmag=1
*plot {vm(n1, gnd) vp(n1, gnd)}
plot {vm(n1,gnd) vp(n1,gnd) im(la,n1) ip(la,n1)}	* <--- Try this!!!

la n1 gnd 100n

***********************************************************************

	There is a phase shift in the current, but there is no
voltage phase shift across an element when a source and an element
are directly connected together.
