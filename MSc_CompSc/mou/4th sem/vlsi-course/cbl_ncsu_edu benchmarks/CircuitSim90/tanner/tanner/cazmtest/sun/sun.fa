* @(#)models	1.2 11/19/90
*
* These models were derived from files "models" and "skew.parameters"
* in the typical-typical case.  Parameters not needed by CAzM were
* deleted.
*
* Hspice's models were based on:
*	+ Meta-Software's variable saturation model (SAT=3)
*	+ Charge conserving, symmetric capacitor model (CAPOP=1)
*	+ Physically based method for area calculation (ACM=1)
*
* CAzM models are based on:
*	+ Statz model (SAT=2)
*	+ Artificial charge splitting capacitor model
*	+ SPICE method for area calculation (ACM=0)
