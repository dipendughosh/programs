Subject: cazm bug


i've come across a rather interesting problem with cazm v4.1.
when i use acmodel to print the model parameters, some values,
especially VDSAT, appear to be shifted, i.e., the value for M1
appears in M2's column, etc.  i'm not sure whether this is
actually what is happening, but i do know that transistors
which i know MUST have identical ac models do not.  have you
noticed this before?  if so, can you tell me whether its just
a problem with the acmodel output routines, or is cazm actually
using the incorrect models during ac analysis.

if you want to talk more about this, please call me at 737-7452.
