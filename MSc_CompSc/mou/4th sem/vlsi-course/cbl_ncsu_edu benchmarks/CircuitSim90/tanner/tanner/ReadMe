Mary Ann-

I think the stuff here should keep you busy for a while. As far as the MESFET
stuff, you'll find cazmtest/helios and cazmtest/sun most useful. The helios
directory contains the original Hspice netlists and models we ran CAzM against.

There are also a few scripts and things we used for our regression testing in
times past. I have no idea if they work still, but if they do, they can be a
real time-saver.

As far as SUXES, I put on a version that's about 3 years old. The makefile
will need to be modified to point to libmod.a and libsim.a on the machine
you want to make it on. Running it is pretty straightforward, like most 
other optimizers you have used... give it a file with bounds, guesses, etc.
and some data and it goes off and does its thing. Often the wrong thing, but
what the heck... that's what we get the big bucks for. I don't know how much
use it will be to you.

Enjoyed your visit here to RTP, NC. If I get out to southern CA, I'll have
to visit Tanner. If you need any more info or help, please feel free to con-
tact me; I don't do simulators much any more, but I'll do what I can to help.
