Great suggestion on printing out the parameters BEFORE modelling.  Actually
we already did this:  turned out jge had a slight bug in his initial version,
due to using the wrong one of the 3 or so different transconductances in
some calculation.  So, to figure out what the hell was going on, he hacked
spice to print out Vth, Von, Ids, and other stuff, then hacked his cazm to
do the same.  It was in the process of pouring over these that he figured
out his problem.  Do you think we need to do more?  The bottom line was that
things seemed to agree very well with spice2.

As for the tests, I've got them all bundled up in directories with makefiles.
I'll just transport the little suckers over to simon, and put them under
/mcnc/mcnc/jp/cazm/mos3/...   You'll have to change some dependencies in the
makefiles and you'll have to snarf our strange HP models (don't tell anyone),
then you can run them over there.

Thanks for the continuing dialog!
