* This file is a pair of inverters, the first driving
* the second with very high fanout.  The purpose is to
* accentuate the Miller capacitance in the second inverter
* to produce the characteristic "kink" in the rising and
* falling waveforms.

* I1
m0 GND in i1 GND nfet l=1.6u w=4u
m1 Vdd in i1 Vdd pfet l=1.6u w=4u

*I2
m2 GND i1 out GND nfet l=1.6u w=100u
m3 Vdd i1 out Vdd pfet l=1.6u w=100u
