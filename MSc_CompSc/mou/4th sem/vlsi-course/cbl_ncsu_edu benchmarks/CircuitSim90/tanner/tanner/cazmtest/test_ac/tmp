/* Simple program to perform automated analysis of analog functional blocks. 
Possibilites are:

AC Analysis:
	BW	- Bandwidth (open-loop 0db point)
	AVOL	- Open-loop DC gain
	GBW	- Gain-bandwidth product
	PSRR	- AC power supply rejection ratio
	CMRR	- AC common mode rejection ratio
	PM	- Phase margin (phase at fBW)
	GM	- Gain margin (gain at phase reversal)

Transient Analysis:
	SRP	- Slew rate (with 1V P-P) in + direction
	SRM	- Slew rate (with 1V P-P) in - direction
	STP	- Closed-loop settling time (+ step)
	STM	- Closed-loop settling time (- step)

DC Analysis:
	IDD	- Power supply current
	PD	- Power dissipation

Following are the sorts of variances that may be specified in the setup file:

PARAM <COMP> VAL1, VAL2, VAL2, ..., VALN	Component varying
PARAM TEMP VAL1, ..., VALN			Temperature varying
PARAM MODEL <MOD1>, <MOD2>, ..., <MODN>		Model varying
PARAM VOLT VAL1, VAL2, ..., VALN		DC voltage source varying

Analyses are specified as follows:

DCANAL [IDD] [PD]
TRANAL [SRP] [SRM] [STP] [STM]
ACANAL [BW] [AVOL] [GBW] [PSRR] [CMRR] [PM] [GM]

Uses a setup file which is parsed in and action taken. Reads in a single CAzM
output file which contains one to all of the analyses required per parameter.
