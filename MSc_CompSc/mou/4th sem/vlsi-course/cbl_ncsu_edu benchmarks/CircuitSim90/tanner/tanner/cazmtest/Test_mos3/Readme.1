Great.  JGE changed his version, and I have installed a copy of it in our
local (MSL) environment.  We're gonna try it for awhile and see how it goes.
I've been testing the sucker to death.  Let me try this on you to see if
you can suggest anything else we should be doing:

(1) DC parametrics on short/narrow, long/narrow, short/wide, long/wide
    nfet's and pfet's.  Curves appear about right, given cazm's step-wise
    approximation to the drain characteristics.  Idsat agrees with spice
    (both 2g6 and 3b1) to about 1% or so.  These tests are our main reason 
    for thinking jge's current module is working right.

(2) Simulated a simple 1-T circuit instrumented up to look at currents 
    due to charges sloshing on and off gate and drain terminals during
    positive and negative voltage pulses on Vgate.  Agreed substantially
    with both spice2 and spice3.

(3) Simulated charges sloshing on and off the drain terminals of various
    sized transistors, all turned off (so that the main effects are due
    to junction capacitances).  Close agreement with s2 and s3.

(4) Simulated a 2-inverter circuit sized to enhance the Miller effect.
    Close agreement with s2 and s3.

We're taking (2)-(4) as evidence that jge's charge model is working right.

(5) Simulated drain characteristics for nfet and pfet at 27C and 100C.  Got
    <=1% aggreement with spice2 (spice3 doesn't model temperature).  Take
    this to mean the T-model is right.

(6) 1-fet modelling of body effect.  Again agreement to ~1% with spice2.

(7) Models we're using don't include Nfs.  Built some fake models with Nfs
    set to some outrageous value.  Got 1% aggreement for sat drain currents
    at Vgs ~ Vth.  Take this to mean jge got that equation right, too.

(8) Modelled a complex circuit (8-bit carry/select adder) for several cycles.
    Got apparently good agreement (looking at the results with wavex).  Worst-
    case differences in timing were about 0.45ns, and the circuit was modelled
    with a 25ns clock.  Gave us a nice warm feeling.

Can you think of anything else??

Also:  Eyles and I have been puzzling over this business of "dividing the
channel charge" between the source and drain.  Seems like if we make the
division ANYthing except 50-50, cazm croaks, complaining of too-small 
timesteps.  Any idea why??  John's using the level-3 charge model, more
or less.
