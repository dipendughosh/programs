                               GENERAL
                               =======  

This document has been generated in response to user requests and its main
purpose is to facilitate parsing the existing set of partitioning
benchmarks. This README file resides in 
         
	      pub/benchmark/Partitioning93/Translators/ 

The following subdirectories have been created within this directory:


   Map2PNF/                   -            subdirectory 1
              README          -       information       |
              map2pnf         -       shell script      |
              map2pnf.awk     -       awk script        |
              example.map     -       map netlist       |
                                                  ......|

   PNF_Parse/                 -            subdirectory 2
              README          -       information       |
              Makefile        -       for installation  |
              macros.h        -       header            |
              main_pnf        -       C code            |

In the subdirectory Map2PNF we recommend that you execute shellscript
"map2pnf example"  which will generate a file "example.pnf". To see the
usage for this shell command, just type "map2pnf" with no arguments.

In the subdirectory PNF_Parse we recommend that you execute Makefile  which
will generate object code, read the existing file "example.pnf", and output
miscellaneous netlist statistics for this example.
