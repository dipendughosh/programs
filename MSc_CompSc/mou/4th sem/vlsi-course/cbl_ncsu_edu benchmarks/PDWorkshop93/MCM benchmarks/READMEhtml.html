This "pub/benchmark/PDWorkshop93/MCM_benchmarks" directory contains a set of
public-domain benchmark examples related to MCM routing. 
 

Professor Jason Cong at UCLA initiated the effort of creating a set of 
MCM routing benchmark examples in 1991 and has been coordinating the effort
since then.  The two MCM routing examples in the current benchmark suite were
provided by Deborah Cobb at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corporation (MCC),  who also helped to obtain permission from the Control
Device International to release the examples.  Kei-Yong Khoo at UCLA 
volunteered much of his time in setting up the two benchmark examples and
providing necessary format conversion and documentation.


The files in directory contain some large MCM routing examples, and supporting
documentation. A description of the contents of each file is given below. 


The original netlists from MCC are:
			mcc1.mcc
			mcc2.mcc

The converted netlists for gridded routing are:
		mcc1-75.net    (75 micron grid)
		mcc2-45.net    (45 micron grid)
		mcc2-75.net    (75 micron grid)

The formats for MCC and gridded netlists are described in:
			netlist.doc

Additional information about the examples are in:
			mcc1.doc
			mcc2.doc

All the above contents of this directory have been also been made available
in the following single compressed tar-file:
			MCM_benchmarks.tar.Z

If you have access to the UNIX 'tar' and 'compress' facilities, then you
can simply retrieve the above file, and unpack it to obtain the complete set
of benchmarks and documentation listed here.


Questions regarding the internal structure and the format of the benchmark
examples should be forwarded to Khoo Kei-Yong (khoo@cs.ucla.edu) or
Professor Jason Cong (cong@cs.ucla.edu) at the UCLA Computer Science
Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024.


Questions regarding the retrieval of these or other Design Automation
benchmarks should be directed to the the Benchmark Administrator at
sengupta@mcnc.org or benchmarks@mcnc.org. Please consult the Benchmark
Newsletter (file: pub/benchmark/NEWS/Newsletter93.06) and the README file
pub/benchmark/README for more information about the Design Automation
benchmarks archived here at MCNC.
