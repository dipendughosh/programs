This routing example models a next generation supercomputer on a
6 x 6 inch substrate with 37 Honeywell VHSIC gate arrays and 18
high density connectors. The chips are 1.5 x 1.5 cm. with 35 mil
TAB leads on a 4 mil pitch. The connectors are placed around the
perimeter of the substrate.

The net list contains 7118 signal nets and 14659 pins.

In the mcc netlist file, the DEVICES section gives the footprint
of the chip CHIP and connectors EXT2 and PRT. The ELEMENTS
section gives the placement on a 6 x 6 inch square with lower
left corner at (0, 0).
