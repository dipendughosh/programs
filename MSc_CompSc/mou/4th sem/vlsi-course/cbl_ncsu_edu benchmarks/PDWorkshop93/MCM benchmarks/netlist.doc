(A) NETLIST FORMAT FOR GRID-ROUTER
###################################

The netlist is given by a simple ASCII file. This format is
universal to the SLICE, V4 and V4R router.  The netlist
specifies the connectivity and the pin (terminal) locations.

The file consists of lines in the following format:

<x> <y> <z> <net>

followed by a single line

-1

<x>,<y>,<z> are the coordinates of the terminal. The coordinate
value begins with 0 (.i.e x,y,z >= 0). Note that the z
coordinate value is ignored for the SLICE, V4 and V4R router.

<net> is the (integer) net number of the terminal . All the
terminals of the same net are to be connected together. This
number must be unique for each terminal location. A special net
number of -1 indicates an obstacle. A special net number of 0
indicates a place holder. The place holder is used to define the
size of the routing region (see example below).

Example:
1 1 0 1
1 2 0 1
1 3 0 1
2 2 0 2
2 4 0 2
9 9 0 0
-1

This example shows a net list with 5 terminals. It has 1
3-terminal net and 1 2-terminal net. The routing area is 10x10.



(B) FORMAT OF MCC NETLIST
#########################
The netlist file contains a DEVICES, ELEMENTS, and NETLIST
section. The units are 1000 per micron.  The DEVICES section
gives the footprint of the chips and connectors.  The ELEMENTS
section gives the placement with lower left corner at (0, 0).
The NETLIST section associates a net number and net name with
each pin.  No power or ground pins are identified. It is assumed
that power and ground pins will be directly connected to power
and ground metal layers.

In the ELEMENT section, the last (5th) field indicates the
orientation of the DEVICE:
   0 = no rotation
   1 = 90 degree clockwise rotation
   2 = 180 degree CW
   3 = 270 degree CW
   4 = reflection y->-y
   5 = reflection y->-y followed by 90 degree CW rotation
   6 =     "    "         "       180   "
   7 =     "    "         "       270   "
