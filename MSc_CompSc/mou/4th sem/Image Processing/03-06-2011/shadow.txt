take 2 array.
1 that contains the regions(b[]). othar contains the original imagea(a[]).

take each region
start from (1,1)
find out the (i,j)th position in b[],that contains pixel value 257. now goto the (i,j)th position of a[]. take the whole region. 

calculate the avg pixel value of each region.
if avg >= 245 && avg <=255  //black region
{
	p=find any pixel in region of b[](x,y)
	for i=1 to row
	{
	  for j=1 to col
	  {
		if b[i][j]=257
		{ 
		    if j<y
		       p=(i,j) //the left most point of the region
	   }
	}
		
	p1= one of the 4 neighbor of p which is black
	p2= another 4 neighbor which is black
	mark visited pixel
	d=euclidean distance of p1 p2.
	do
	{
		p1= one of the 4 neighbor of p1which is black and not visited
		p2= another 4 neighbor which is black
		mark visited pixel
		d=euclidean distance of p1 p2.
		if d1>d
		d=d1  //vertival length
	}
	find the horizontal length dd
}
