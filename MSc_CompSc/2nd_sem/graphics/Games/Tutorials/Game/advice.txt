    * New shooter developed in FinalGameVar1.1.JPG.
    * Bullets changed in Game2.
    * UFO's changes in both Games.

Problems To Be Solved :

    * See the distortion in the Bullet Nozzle in FinalGameVar1.1_sample2.JPG.
    * The number of bullets in Game2 is a lot.
    * The Speed of UFOSup in game1 suddelny increases.

Improvement scope :

    * Due to the creation of the New Shooter the codes for the creation is redundant for both parent type 0 ad 1. It wil be really good if we can find some way to avoid that redundancy , subject to it does not complicate the design.
