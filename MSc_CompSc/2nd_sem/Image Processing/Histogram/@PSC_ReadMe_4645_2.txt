Title: Image Histogram Processing
Description: This is another project I have done last month. The programme can load several image format (derived from my project of Digital Image Compression Algorithm) then it can compute 1-D histogram of the image (grey, red, green, blue channel). I also developed some simple functions e.g histogram equalisation, contrast stretch, negative, channel boost.
I hope you can find it interesting and helpful.
