I am sendinding you the following two IP assignmnts :
a) Zooming & Shrinking of a moderate size image by any scale.
b) Suppose a practical image (e.g. crowd, forest etc) is given . Apply Histogram Equalisation(HE) on it. Show the frequency response graph before & after applying HE .
If they have any query feel free to ask me.
