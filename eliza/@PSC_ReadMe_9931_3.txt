Title: Artificial Intelligence - Chatterbot Eliza v1.4
Description: 	The implementation of the program has been improved, the repetitions made by the program
		are better handled, the context in a conversation is also better handled, the program can now
		correct grammatical errors that can occure after conjugating verbs. Finaly, the database is
		bigger than the last time, it includes some of the script that originaly was used in the first
		implementation of the chatterbot Eliza by Joseph Weizenbaum.
These program is an Eliza like chatterbot,bots like Eliza are the results
		of researchs in Artificial Intelligence (more specificly: in NLP and NLU)
		NLP: Natural Language Processing, NLU: Natural Language Understanding
		The first chatterbot was published in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum a professor of MIT.
		(http://i5.nyu.edu/~mm64/x52.9265/january1966.html)
		And also,most of the chatterbots that have been written this days are largely based
		on the original chatterbot Eliza that was written by Joseph Weizenbaum which means
		that they use some appropriate keywords to select the responses to generate
		when they get new inputs from the users. More generaly,the techique that are 
		in use in a "chatterbot database" or "script file" to represent the chatterbot
		knowledge is known as "Case Base Reasoning" or CBR. A very good example of an Eliza
		like chatterbot would be "Alice",these program has won the Loebner prize for most
		human chatterbot three times (www.alicebot.org). The goal of NLP and NLU is to create
		programs that are capable of understanding natural languages and also capable
		of processing it to get input from the user by "voice recognition" or to produce
		output by "text to speech". During the last decades there has been a lot of progress
		in the domains of "Voice Recognition" and "Text to Speech",however the goal of NLU
		that is to make software that are capable of showing a good level of understanding
		of "natural languages" in general seems quiet far to many A.I experts. The general
		view about this subject is that it would take at list many decades before any computer 
		can begin to really understand "natural language" just as the humans do.
